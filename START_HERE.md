## 🎓 Understanding Your Stack

### Frontend Layer
- **Next.js 14+**: Server & client components
- **React 18**: Latest features
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **Shadcn/ui**: Beautiful components

### Backend Layer
- **Next.js API Routes**: Built-in backend
- **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database
- **NextAuth.js**: Authentication
- **Zod**: Input validation

### Services Layer
- **Stripe**: Payment processing
- **OpenAI**: AI capabilities
- **Resend**: Email delivery
- **Upstash**: Rate limiting (optional)

### Database Layer

- **15+ tables**: Fully relational

---

## 🔥 Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Start Simple
Don't configure all services at once. Start with just:
1. Supabase (database)
2. NextAuth secret

Get those working, then add Stripe, OpenAI, etc. as needed.

### Tip 2: Use Prisma Studio
```bash
npx prisma studio
```
Opens a GUI to view and edit your database. Super helpful!

### Tip 3: Check the Browser Console
All errors show in the browser console. Keep it open during development.

### Tip 4: Use the Documentation
8 documentation files = answers to every question. Use `INDEX.md` to find what you need.

### Tip 5: Deploy Early
Deploy to Vercel staging early. Test in production-like environment.

## 🎨 Customization Quick Wins

### Change Brand Colors (2 minutes)
Edit `tailwind.config.ts`:
```typescript
colors: {
  primary: '#YOUR_COLOR',
}
```

### Update Site Name (1 minute)
Edit `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=YourBrand
```

### Change Logo (5 minutes)
Replace `<Brain />` icon in:
- `components/layout/Navbar.tsx`
- `components/layout/Footer.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### About File Names
The new Next.js files have `-nextjs` suffix to avoid conflicts:
- `package-nextjs.json` → rename to `package.json`
- `tsconfig-nextjs.json` → rename to `tsconfig.json`
- `env.nextjs.example` → copy to `.env.local`

Your old Vite files remain untouched! You can keep them as backup.

### About the Database
The Prisma schema includes both:
- ✅ All existing tables (users, bookings, availability, etc.)
- ✅ New tables (workflows, documents, subscriptions, etc.)

Running `prisma db push` is safe - it only adds new tables.

### About Dependencies
The new `package.json` includes:
- ✅ All your existing dependencies
- ✅ New dependencies (Next.js, Prisma, etc.)
- ✅ Total size: ~200MB of node_modules

---

✅ `npm run dev` starts without errors
